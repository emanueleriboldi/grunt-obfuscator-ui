# What is this?
This is an improved version with UI added by me of https://github.com/SpartanB312/Grunt, credit of Grunt goes to @SpartanB312 on GitHub.â€‹

# Is this safe?
If you think I've provided a malware, download the source code (.zip file) and compile yourself.
I've wrote this with Eclipse, you might download that to compile.

# I get "A java exception has occurred" when I open the .jar. How can I fix this?
This is a common problem that happens when you have a minor version of Java 19 since class file version is 63.0 (Java 19).
You can easly fix by downloading Java 19 from here: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk19-archive-downloads.html and then rebooting the PC. The issue should be fixed.
However, if for some reason it still doesn't work, you can create an issue from "Issues" section and I will try to respond as soon as possible.
